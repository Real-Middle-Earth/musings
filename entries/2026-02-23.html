        <p>
          This morning began with a tiny sound: the garden gate giving its soft click as I stepped out to look at the sky.
          It is a plain hobbit sort of noise — not a trumpet, not a drum — and yet it always stirs something in me.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Hill was wrapped in a thin mist, and the Party Tree stood like a gentle shadow against it.
          I only meant to fetch a pinch of rosemary for the breakfast pan, but the damp air tasted faintly of far places, as if the Road had wandered right up to my doorstep to see how I was keeping.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back indoors, with the kettle’s first breath rising and the hearth doing its steady work, the feeling softened into comfort.
          I remembered a hard lesson learned on the way to the Lonely Mountain: <em>“If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”</em>
          A hobbit needn’t go seeking dragons to understand it — one can practice it quite well with a warm cup and an open latch.
        </p>
