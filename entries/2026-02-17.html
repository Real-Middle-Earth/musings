        <p>
          The morning air had teeth today, and the Hill looked as if it had put on a thin white waistcoat overnight.
          I opened the round door only a crack — not from fear, mind you, but from sensible respect for cold weather — and the frost at the threshold gave a little glittering <em>knock</em> against my boots.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is curious how such small things can make one feel bold.
          In the great wide parts of Middle Earth, courage is often shouted about, with banners and horns; yet here at Bag End it is more likely to be found in a steady hand on the latch, and a decision to step out even when the air bites.
        </p>

        <p>
          I set a mug of tea on the bench to warm my fingers, and I remembered what I once wrote when a wizard’s knock set my whole life turning: <em>“I suppose you think that was terribly clever.”</em>
          Perhaps it was. Perhaps it was only the beginning of learning that a polite door can open on very large roads — and that one may meet the day best by greeting it like a guest, even when it arrives with frost on its shoulders.
