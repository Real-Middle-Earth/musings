        <p>
          There are mornings when the Shire feels tucked away under a quilt of dark — the kind of hour when even the birds are still negotiating whether it is worth it.
          On such a morning I like to light a small lantern on the kitchen table, not because I cannot see without it, but because the glow makes the whole smial feel kind.
        </p>

        <p>
          The kettle begins its first soft song, and the flame throws warm shapes against the walls — round as the door, steady as the Hill itself.
          A great deal of courage in Middle Earth is nothing grander than this: doing the next plain thing, before one is entirely certain one is ready.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have learned (from trolls, goblins, and one very unnecessary dragon) that the dark is often only waiting to be answered.
          <em>“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something.”</em> So I look: at the day ahead, at the road outside, and at the honest little circle of light that says, quietly, <em>begin</em>.
