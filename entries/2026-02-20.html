          The rain began before dawn and has been politely persistent ever since, like a visitor who will not accept that the kettle needs time.
          I watched it bead and run down the round window, and for a while I felt as snug as a seedcake in its tin.

          Yet even on the wettest mornings the Road has a way of clearing its throat.
          A map on the table (quite harmless, one would think) can make the heart lean forward, and the mind begins packing: handkerchief, courage, and perhaps just one more biscuit for the pocket.
        </p>

          I remembered an old truth from my own pages: <em>“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something.”</em>
          Looking does not always mean stepping out into puddles at once — sometimes it means noticing what is already at hand in Middle Earth: the steady sound of rain, the warmth of tea, and the quiet promise that fair weather will come again.
