        <p>
          There was frost on the grass this morning, and a thin white bite in the air that sent me straight to the pantry before I’d even finished admiring it.
          I have lived long enough in Middle Earth to know that comfort is often just good sense wearing a pleasant waistcoat.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I made a little round of my stores: tea in its tin, seed-cakes in their proper jar, a twist of cheese, and a small bundle of string that always seems to vanish at the worst moments.
          It is a homely business, and yet it steadies the heart — like checking your pack before a hill, even if you only mean to walk as far as the garden gate.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the Road I once learned, to my surprise, that looking is a kind of courage.
          I can still hear my own words as plain as if they were written fresh: <em>“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something.”</em>
          One does not always find what one expects — but one does find what one needs to remember.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the kettle began its first cheerful sigh, I felt quite ready for whatever the day might bring (and if it brings nothing at all, that is also a respectable outcome).
          After all, a warm cup and a well-kept latch can make even a cold morning feel like a friendly place to begin.
